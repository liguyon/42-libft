.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The libft library is a collection of general purpose functions designed
to be used in the 42 school curriculum.
It provides various utility functions to handle strings, memory,
standard input/output character types, and more.
.PP
To use the libft library, include the header file libft.h in your C
source code:
.PP
\f[B]#include \[lq]libft.h\[rq]\f[R]
.PP
Then, compile the library using its Makefile:
.PP
\f[B]make -C /path/to/library\f[R]
.PP
Finally, compile your program with the following flags:
.PP
\f[B]cc file.c -I/path/to/libft/include -L/path/to/libft -lft\f[R]
.PP
This will link your program with the libft library and allow you to use
any of the available functions.
.PP
Refer to the individual man pages for each submodule to learn more about
their functionalities and how to use them.
